1-wire Wall-Mount Temperature Sensor
====================================

I wanted some inoffensive looking wall-mount temperature sensors for my house
but found the available off-the-shelf modules to be very expensive. Given how 
simple a 1-wire temperature sensor circuit is, I decided to try and build my own.

The circuit diagram and PCB design were both created using [Ki-CAD],
an Open Source suite of programme for electronic design.
